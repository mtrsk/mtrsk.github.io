  <h2>Switching To Nixos

  </h2><p>After quite some time being a Debian user I&rsquo;ve decided to become a full time
meme distro user. At first I was following some of the manuals in an attempt to
recreate my config in virtualbox. A day later this distro seemed too cool not to
try it out for real, so why not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kinda weird to adapt, in Debian I was accostumed to just run a command here
and there and have a bunch of config files across my system, with <a href="https://nixos.org/nix">Nix</a> (the
configuration language) one can have a single file (<code>configuration.nix</code>) to
manager everything and, since Nix is also a programming language, you can
modularize it to make things easier to manage. NixOS is also quite forgiving
when it comes to experimenting, you can always rollback your entire system to a
previous generation if something explodes. The <code>#nixos</code> community on both
freenode and <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/">discourse</a> is also very helpful.</p>
<p>If you wanna see my crappy config just take a look <a href="https://github.com/mtrsk/nixos-config">here</a>.</p>
