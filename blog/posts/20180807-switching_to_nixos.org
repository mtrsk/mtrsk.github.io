After quite some time being a Debian user I've decided to become a full time
meme distro user. At first I was following some of the manuals in an attempt to
recreate my config in virtualbox. A day later this distro seemed too cool not to
try it out for real, so why not?

It's kinda weird to adapt, in Debian I was accostumed to just run a command here
and there and have a bunch of config files across my system, with [[https://nixos.org/nix][Nix]] (the
configuration language) one can have a single file (~configuration.nix~) to
manager everything and, since Nix is also a programming language, you can
modularize it to make things easier to manage. NixOS is also quite forgiving
when it comes to experimenting, you can always rollback your entire system to a
previous generation if something explodes. The ~#nixos~ community on both
freenode and [[https://discourse.nixos.org/][discourse]] is also very helpful.

If you wanna see my crappy config just take a look [[https://github.com/mtrsk/nixos-config][here]].
