In 2000, Roy Fielding, then at U.C. Irvine, published a seminal PhD dissertation on the web: “Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures.” Fielding had been working on the open source Apache HTTP Server and his thesis was a description of what he felt was a new and distinct networking architecture that had emerged in the early web. Fielding had worked on the initial HTTP specifications and, in the paper, defined the web’s hypermedia network model using the term REpresentational State Transfer (REST).">
