<blockquote>
<p>The fact that you are managing a programming project means that you will be
running a business. You will have suppliers, you will have one or more
customers. You will have employees, you will have commitments, you will have
financial goals, you will have measured results. (&hellip;) . Your responsibility is
to manage your business so that everyone - your &ldquo;investors&rdquo; (the executives that
gave you the assignment), your customers (the people who will use your system
for a long time to come), your employees (&hellip;), and you - will look at your
operating results and feel a sense of satisfaction.</p>
