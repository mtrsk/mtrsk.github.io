Algebraic Models for Accouting Systems

* Approaches to Accounting Theory
** Algebraic concepts employed
+ Balance vectors
  * A balance vector is a column vector or column matrix the sum of whose entries equals zero.
  * Balance vectors are able to represent the state of an accounting system at any instant.
  * They are also capable of encoding the transactions that are applied to the system.
    
+ Digraph
  * The vertices represent accounts and the edges indicate where there are flows
    of value within the system. Thus a digraph gives a picture of how value can
    flow around an accounting system.
+ Automaton
  * The applicability to accounting is clear: the states of the accounting
    system are the balance vectors, the inputs are the transactions and the
    outputs are the new balance vectors.

* Balance Vectors
** The values of an account

Let there be given a set R together with two binary operations on R called
addition and multiplication, denoted in the usual way, such that the following
rules hold for all elements $a, b, c \in R$:

\begin{align*}
(a + b) + c &= a + (b + c) \tag{1}\\
a + b &= b + a \tag{2}\\
\exists 0 \in R, \forall a \in R, a + 0_r &= a \tag{3}\\
\forall a \in R, \exists (-a) \in R, a + (-a) &= 0 \tag{4}\\
a \times (b \times c) &= (a \times b) \times c \tag{5}\\
a \times b &= b \times a \tag{6}\\
a \times (b + c) &= a \times b + a \times c \tag{7}\\
\exists 1 \in R, \forall a \in R, a \times 1 &= a \tag{8}
\end{align*}

The first four of these requirements assert that *R* is an algebraic structure
called an *[[id:6550857e-ec3f-4b76-80ce-9b86df92601e][Abelian Group]]*. With the additional properties (5) through (8) R
becomes a *[[id:44839048-b783-4a37-9267-b8e59160d90f][Commutative Ring]]* with identity.

A commutative ring with identity *R* is said to be *linearly ordered* if there is a
non-empty subset *P* of *R* not containing 0, called the set of positive elements,
such that the following conditions are satisfied:

\begin{align*}
a,b \in P \implies a + b \in P &\wedge a \times b \in P \tag{9}\\
\forall a \in R, (a \in P) \lor (a = 0) &\lor (-a \in P) \tag{10}\\
\end{align*}

The actual concept of a linear order arises when one defines a < b to mean that
b − a \in P. The negative elements of R are the elements of the set R \ (P ∪
{0}). On the basis of (9) and (10) it can be shown that the following holds:

\begin{align*}
\forall a,b \in R, (a < b) \lor (a = b) &\lor (a > b) \tag{11}\\
a,b \in R \wedge a \times b = 0 \implies a = 0 &\lor b = 0 \tag{12}\\
\end{align*}

** The State of an Accounting System

Let *R* be an *ordered domain*, which will be the universal set for all account
values, and let n be a positive integer, which will be the number of accounts in
the accounting system. The state of the system at any instant can be described
by listing the values of the accounts, which are assumed to be in some agreed
order, in the form of an n-column vector over *R*.

\begin{equation*}
V = \begin{bmatrix}
v_1 \\ 
v_2 \\ 
\vdots \\ 
v_n \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Thus v_i \in R is the value of the ith account. The set of all n-column vectors over R is denoted by R^n. 

Of particular importance is the zero vector:

\begin{equation*}
0 = \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ 
0 \\ 
\vdots \\ 
0 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Addition can also be defined:

\begin{equation*}
u + v = \begin{bmatrix}
u_1 + v_1 \\ 
u_2 + v_2 \\ 
\vdots \\ 
u_n + v_n \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

as well as scalar products:

\begin{equation*}
r \times v = \begin{bmatrix}
r \times v_1 \\ 
r \times v_2 \\ 
\vdots \\ 
r \times v_n \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Let $u, v, w \in R^n$ and $r, s \in R$:

\begin{align*}
(u + v) + w &= u + (v + w) \tag{1}\\
u + v &= v + u \tag{2}\\
v + 0 &= v \tag{3}\\
v + (-v) &= 0 \tag{4}\\
r \times (u + v) &= r \times u + r \times v \tag{5}\\
(r + s) \times u &= r \times u + s \times u \tag{6}\\
(r \times s) \times v &= r \times (s \times v) \tag{7}\\
1_R \times v &= v \tag{8}
\end{align*}

These properties demonstrate that the set R^n has a recognizable algebraic
structure. Indeed properties (1) – (4) assert that R^n is an [[id:6550857e-ec3f-4b76-80ce-9b86df92601e][Abelian Group]], while
the additional properties (5) through (8) make R^n into a [[id:e4bd8f7b-a64d-4da3-b1e8-289d6fb0c441][Left R-Module]].

*** The free R-module R^n

It turns out that R^n is a particular type of R-module called a Free R-module. To
see what is special about it, consider the so-called elementary column vectors
e(1), e(2), ... , e(n) where the ith entry of e(i) is 1 = 1_R and all other
entries are 0. Thus:

\begin{equation*}
e(1) = \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 
0 \\ 
\vdots \\ 
0 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}, \,
e(2) = \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ 
1 \\ 
\vdots \\ 
0 \\ 
\end{bmatrix},
\,\, (\ldots) \,\,,
e(n) = \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ 
0 \\ 
\vdots \\ 
n \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Now an arbitrary vector $v \in R^n$ is expressible in terms of these
elementary vectors since:

\begin{equation*}
v = v_1 \times e(1) + v_2 \times e(2) + \dots + v_n \times e(n)
\end{equation*}

#+BEGIN_CENTER
The set of elementary vectors {e(1), . . . , e(n)} is an R-basis of R^n, so that R^n is a free R-module of rank n.

*** Balance vectors in R^n

The accounts of a company generally fall into three categories:

1. /Asset accounts/, which represent anything owned by the company
2. /Liability accounts/, which record what is owed by the company to external entities
3. /Equity accounts/ or a /profit and loss account/; these show what is owed by the
   company to the owners and also show the net assets of the company.

It is a fundamental fact that a double entry accounting system must always be in
balance, a fact which is implied by the accounting equation:

\begin{equation*}
A - L = E
\end{equation*}

We proceed now to study the properties of the subset of balance vectors in R^n,
where R is an ordered domain.

First, let us consider the function σ : R^n → R, which sums the entries of a
column vector $v \in R^n$. 

\begin{equation*}
\sigma(v) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} v_i
\end{equation*}

σ has the following properties:

\begin{align*}
\sigma(v + w) &= \sigma(v) + \sigma(w) \\
\sigma(rv) &= r \sigma(v)\\
\forall v,w \in R^n, r \in R
\end{align*}

A function between two R-modules with these properties is called an [[id:e41608f8-fcf2-4b02-b502-9441c0aee369][R-Module Homomorphism]].

Module elements which are sent to zero by a module homomorphism σ form a subset
called the *kernel*, written $\text{Ker}(\sigma)$.

Returning to the particular homomorphism σ, we conclude that its kernel,
i.e. the set of balance vectors, is a submodule of R^n. We shall write
$\text{Baln} (R)$ for the set of all balance vectors in R^n, so that
$\text{Ker}(\sigma) = \text{Baln}(R)$ is a submodule of R^n, which will be called the
balance module of degree n over R.
