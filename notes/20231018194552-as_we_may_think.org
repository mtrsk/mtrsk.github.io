#+TITLE: As We May Think

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In this article Bush described a device called a Memex, which, using a complex
mechanical system of reels and microfilm, along with an encoding system, would
allow users to jump between related frames of content. The Memex was never
actually implemented, but it was an inspiration for later work on the idea of
Hypermedia.
