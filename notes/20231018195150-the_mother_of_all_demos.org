#+TITLE: The Mother of All Demos

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Englebart demonstrated an unbelievable amount of technology:

 * Remote, collaborative text editing with his peers in Menlo Park
 * Video and audio chat
 * An integrated windowing system, with window resizing, etc
 * A recognizable hypertext, whereby clicking on underlined text navigated to new content

Despite receiving a standing ovation from a shocked audience after his talk, it was decades before the technologies Englebart demonstrated became mainstream.
