The Erlang view of the world can be summarized in the following statments
[cite:@armstrong2003]:

+ Everything is a process.
+ Processes are strongly isolated.
+ Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.
+ Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.
+ Processes have unique names.
+ If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.
+ Error handling is non-local.
+ Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.
