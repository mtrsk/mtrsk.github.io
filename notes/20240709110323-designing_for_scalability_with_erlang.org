[[id:6ed3a191-0128-453e-b0b6-37c48593a6f0][OTP]] is said to consist of three building blocks that, when used together, provide a solid approach to designing and developing systems in the
problem domain weâ€™ve just described. They are [[id:de7d0e94-618f-4982-b3e5-8806d88cad5d][Erlang]] itself, tools and libraries,
and a set of design principles. [cite:@cesarini2016designing p.20]
