#+TITLE: Byzantine Generals Problem

A summary from [cite:@lamport2019byzantine] paper.

* Introduction

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A reliable computer system must be able to cope with the failure of one or more
of its components. A failed component may exhibit a type of behavior that is
often overlooked namely, sending conflicting information to different parts of
the system. The problem of coping with this type of failure is expressed
abstractly as the *Byzantine Generals Problem*.
#+END_QUOTE

** The Classic Problem

+ Each division of Byzantine army is directed by its own general
+ Generals, some of which are traitors, communicate each other by messengers

The generals must have an algorithm that guarantess the following properties:

1. All loyal generals decide upon the same plan of action.
2. A small number of traitors cannot cause the loyal generals to adopt a bad
   plan.

which can then be restated as:

1. All loyal generals receive the same information upon which they will somehow get to the same decision
2. The information sent by a loyal general should be used by all the other loyal generals.

This problem is then further reformulated into what into a series of one
commanding general and multiple lieutenants problem.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Byzantine Generals Problem*: A commanding general must send an order to his $n -
1$ lieutenant generals such that,
+ All *loyal* lieutenants obey the *same* order.
+ If the commanding general is *loyal*, then every *loyal* lieutenant *obeys* the
order he sends. 
#+END_QUOTE

* Impossibility Results

** 3-General Problem with 1 Traitor
This is a special case of BGP and it's unsolvable because a loyal lieutenant
cannot distinguish betwee a loyal/traitorous officer when conflicting
information arrives.
