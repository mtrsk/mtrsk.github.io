* Definition

Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD) is a distributed replicated storage
system for the [[id:8a427ee7-2ef1-489b-af82-91de7be8a3ba][Linux]] platform.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you want to create an environment where multiple nodes can access your data simultaneously, the distributed
replicated block device (DRBD) is an excellent choice. This is particularly true if you want to set up a two-node cluster,
in which one node must be able to take over the exact state of the other node as fast as possible. The DRBD performs a
delta-sync of blocks over the network, which ensures that youâ€™ll have the exact same state on different machines in a
matter of seconds. [cite:@van2014pro p.109]

+ This is basically RAID-1, but over the network.
+ Syncronization happens at block-device level, after losing connection the Node
  will catch up the changes that happened in the other node.
