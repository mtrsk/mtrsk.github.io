Quorum means "majority", and the idea behind quorum is easy to understand: if
the [[id:d8a1a1ff-47e6-44bc-a627-83ca8dc61ecb][Cluster]] doesnâ€™t have quorum, no actions will be taken in the cluster. This
by itself would offer a good solution to avoid the [[id:582a4090-eb66-4dfd-8166-9acd3c97dcc9][Split Brain]] problem.

But to make sure that it can never happen, that multiple nodes activate the same
resources in the cluster, another mechanism is used as well. This mechanism is
known as [[id:789326a5-20aa-4492-acb6-1474c3c11a4a][STONITH]]. [cite:@van2014pro, p.6]
#+END_QUOTE

This is required to avoid corruption on vital [[id:d8a1a1ff-47e6-44bc-a627-83ca8dc61ecb][Cluster]] resources, such as the
File System.
