* Different Kinds of Clusters

** High Availability Clusters

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The goal of a high availability cluster is to make sure that critical resources
reach the maximum possible availability. This goal is accomplished by installing
cluster software on multiple servers. This software monitors the availability of
the cluster nodes, and it monitors the availability of the services that are
managed by the cluster. If a server goes down, or if the resource stops, the HA
cluster will notice and make sure that the resource is restarted somewhere else
in the cluster, so that it can be used again after a minimal interruption. [cite:@van2014pro]
