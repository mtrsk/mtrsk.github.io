In STONITH, specific hardware is used to terminate a node that is no longer
responsive to the cluster. The idea behind STONITH is that before migrating
resources to another node in the cluster, the cluster has to confirm that the
node in question really is down. To do this, the cluster will send a shutdown
action to the STONITH device, which will, in turn, terminate the nonresponsive
node. [cite:@van2014pro chapter 1]
