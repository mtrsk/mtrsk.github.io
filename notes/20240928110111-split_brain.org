#+title: Split Brain

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Split brain means that the [[id:d8a1a1ff-47e6-44bc-a627-83ca8dc61ecb][Cluster]] is split in two (or more) parts, but both
parts think they are the only remaining part of the cluster. This can lead to
very bad situations when both parts of the cluster try to host the resources
that are offered by the cluster. If the resource is a file system, and multiple
nodes try to write to the file system simultaneously and without coordination,
it may lead to corruption of the file system and the loss of data. As it is the
purpose of a high availability cluster to avoid situations where data could be
lost, this must be prevented no matter what. [cite:@van2014pro, p.6]
