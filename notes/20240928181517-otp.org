[[id:6ed3a191-0128-453e-b0b6-37c48593a6f0][OTP]] is a domain-independent set of frameworks, principles, and patterns that
guide and support the structure, design, implementation, and deployment of
[[id:de7d0e94-618f-4982-b3e5-8806d88cad5d][Erlang]] systems. Using OTP in your projects will help you avoid accidental
complexity: things that are difficult because you picked inadequate
tools. [cite:@cesarini2016designing p.20]
