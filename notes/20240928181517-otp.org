#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[[id:6ed3a191-0128-453e-b0b6-37c48593a6f0][OTP]] is a domain-independent set of frameworks, principles, and patterns that
guide and support the structure, design, implementation, and deployment of
[[id:de7d0e94-618f-4982-b3e5-8806d88cad5d][Erlang]] systems. Using OTP in your projects will help you avoid accidental
complexity: things that are difficult because you picked inadequate
tools. [cite:@cesarini2016designing p.20]

* Behaviors

#+begin_quote
Behaviours are a way of formalizing common patterns in process-oriented
programming. For example, the concept of a server is general and includes a
large portion of all processes you’ll ever need to write. All those processes
have a lot in common—in particular, whether they should be made to follow [[id:6ed3a191-0128-453e-b0b6-37c48593a6f0][OTP]]
conventions for supervision and other things. (...)

Instead, an OTP behaviour takes such a recurring pattern and divides it into two
halves: the generic part and the application-specific implementation part. These
communicate via a simple, well-defined interface. [cite:@logan2010erlang]

** Packaging an Application

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Applications are the way you package related modules in Erlang. The focus here
isn’t on packaging for distribution but on being able to treat a bunch of
modules as a single entity. Although OTP applications can be merely some library
code for others to call, more often they’re like creatures with a life of their
own: they start up, do what they’re designed to do, and shut down. Some can have
multiple running instances, and some are limited to one instance at a time. [cite:@logan2010erlang]
#+END_QUOTE

+ Active Applications have a life cycle and must be started in order to be
  useful.
+ Library Applications are a passive collection of modules to be used by other
  applications, and they don’t need to be started or stopped.
