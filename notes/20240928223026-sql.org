* Logical Query Processing Order

** FROM
*** JOIN
| Step | Description                             |
|------+-----------------------------------------|
|    1 | Cartesian product                       |
|    2 | Qualification step (i.e. the ON filter) |
|    3 | ~LEFT~ or ~RIGHT~ reservations              |

If the specified ~JOIN~ type is a ~CROSS JOIN~, then the query planner stops at Step
1 and return the cartesian product to the next clause. All other join types
proceed to the qualification step.

~INNER~ and ~OUTER~ ~JOINS~ are called "qualified JOINs", the qualification
predicated is specified using the ~ON~ keyword, which filters all rows from the
previous cartesian step where the predicate is ~TRUE~. If the request is an
~INNER JOIN~, then the qualified rows are returned to the next clause, if it is an
~OUTER JOIN~, the qualified rows go throught the next step.
