Haskell is a general purpose, purely [[id:171718cd-10fd-484b-8d77-0ffcffc29163][Functional Programming]] language
incorporating many recent innovations in programming language design. Haskell
provides higher-order functions, non-strict semantics, static polymorphic
typing, user-defined algebraic datatypes, pattern-matching, list comprehensions,
a module system, a monadic I/O system, and a rich set of primitive datatypes,
including lists, arrays, arbitrary and fixed precision integers, and
floating-point numbers. Haskell is both the culmination and solidification of
many years of research on non-strict functional languages.
