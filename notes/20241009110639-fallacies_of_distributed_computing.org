Between 1991 and 1997, engineers at Sun Microsystems collected a list of
mistakes that programmers commonly make when writing software for networked
computers. Bill Joy, Dave Lyon, L Peter Deutsch, and James Gosling cataloged
eight assumptions that developers commonly hold about [[id:d7efb05f-fb8f-438c-b09d-ea91dc24ebc3][Distributed Systems]]. These
assumptions, while obviously incorrect when stated explicitly, nevertheless
inform many of the decisions that the Sun engineers found in systems of the
day. [cite:@perry2024art p.6]
