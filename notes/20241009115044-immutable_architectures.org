#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In 2015, Pat Helland wrote "Immutability Changes Everything", an analysis of
several computing solutions based on immutability. It demonstrates that
immutability solves many problems in several layers of computational
abstraction. (...) . This paper claims no new ideas but only serves to point out
the common thread of immutability in all of these solutions. [cite:@perry2024art]
