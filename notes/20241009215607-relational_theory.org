#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It was late in 1968 that Codd, a mathematician by training, first realized that
the discipline of mathematics could be used to inject some solid principles and
rigor into a field, database management, that prior to that time was all too
deficient in any such qualities. His original definition of the relational model
appeared in an IBM Research Report in 1969 (...) [cite:@date2015sql].
