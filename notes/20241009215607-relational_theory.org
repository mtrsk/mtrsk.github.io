#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It was late in 1968 that Codd, a mathematician by training, first realized that
the discipline of mathematics could be used to inject some solid principles and
rigor into a field, database management, that prior to that time was all too
deficient in any such qualities. His original definition of the relational model
appeared in an IBM Research Report in 1969 (...) [cite:@date2015sql].

* Date's Review of Codd's Original Algebra

The relational model defines a database abstraction based on relations to avoid maintenance overhead. It
has three key ideas:

+ Store database in simple data structures (relations).
+ Physical storage left up to the DBMS implementation.
+ Access data through a high-level language, where the DBMS figures out best execution strategy.

** Structure
The definition of relations and their contents independent of their physical representation

*** Types (or Domains)
*** n-Ary Relations
*** Attributes & Tuples
*** Keys
**** Candidate
**** Primary
**** Foreign

** Integrity
Ensure the database's contents satisfy certain constraints
*** Entity Integrity
*** Referential Integrity

** Manipulation
Programming interface for accessing and modifying a database's contents
