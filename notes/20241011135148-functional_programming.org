#+title: Functional Programming
#+HUGO_CATEGORIES: "Functional Programming"

#+begin_quote
We often refer to the term functional programming, meaning the following programming techniques:

+ Composing functions for structuring programs and using recursion instead of loops.
+ Purity, so that the result of a function is fully determined once its parameters have been fixed.
+ Absence of side effects (doing literally nothing except evaluating the result).
+ Immutability (the inability to change the value of a variable).
