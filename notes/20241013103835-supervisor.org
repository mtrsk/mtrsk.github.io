Supervisors are one of the most important features of [[id:6ed3a191-0128-453e-b0b6-37c48593a6f0][OTP]]. They monitor other
processes and take action if anything goes wrong, restarting the failed process
or possibly escalating the problem to a higher level. Layering supervisors into
supervision trees allows you to create highly fault-tolerant systems. [cite:@logan2010erlang]

A simple-one-for-one supervisor hierarchy. All the child processes are of the
same type and are added or removed dynamically. There can be any number of them.
