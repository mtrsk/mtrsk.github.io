#+begin_quote
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a reference tool for
understanding data communications between any two networked systems. It divides
the communications processes into seven layers. Each layer both performs
specific functions to support the layers above it and offers services to the
layers below it.

* Physical Layer
* Data Link
+ MAC Addressing
+ Flow control
+ Error control: Error detection, followed by correction and/or re-transmition.
+ Line discipline
+ Unit of measure: Frames
* Network
+ IP Addressing
+ Unit of measure: Packets
* Transport
+ Responsible for providing and managing end-to-end transmission of messages
  between two end nodes.
+ Maps transport and network addresses, port-based.

** Protocols
+ TCP: Reliable transfer and guarantees error-free delivery of data in the
  correct order.
+ UDP: "Unreliable" transport, no sequence messages.
