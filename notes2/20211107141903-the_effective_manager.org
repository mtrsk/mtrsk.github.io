* Teachable and Sustainable Skills

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
However you manage, your techniques, behavior, and philosophy must be both
teachable to others and sustainable.
#+END_QUOTE

1. To go up in any organization, you must be able to teach others to do what you
   do.
2. If you're irreplacable, you're also unpromotable.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The way an effective manager manages is visible to others and is teachable to
others. And the effective manager can repeat the

* Know Your People: One On Ones

One on ones are meetings that:

1. That is scheduled
2. That is held weekly
3. That lasts for 30 minutes
4. That is held with each of your directs
5. In which the direct's issues are primary
6. In which the manager takes notes

** Scheduling

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Scheduling your O3s is actually more important than having them weekly. That's
why it's first on our list. It is more important
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Weekly It is best to conduct your One On Ones on a weekly basis. The simplest
reason for this is that you probably think about your work life in weekly
increments.
#+END_QUOTE

How DO you “stay in touch” with those in your organization who
are “below” your directs? First, insist on your subordinate
managers doing One On Ones with their directs. Your
immediate subordinate managers are responsible for their
relationships with their directs. The way you maintain your
relationship with your skips (and even levels below that, if it
applies to you) is by keeping a strong relationship with your
directs and relying on them to maintain relationships with theirs.
Any other model for this just doesn't scale.

What this means is that you won't be able to have the same
relationship with people who are two or more levels down from
you. You won't, but it's okay, because you're not supposed to.
Efforts to do so are a waste of your most precious resource as a
manager: your time. Build an organization of effective managers

* Talk about performance - Feedback

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The second critical manager behavior that leads to results and retention is
communicating about performance.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When the average manager gives feedback, the focus is on what happened. The
manager thinks about what happened in the past and asks herself how to talk to
the direct—about what happened, in the past, about which the manager can do
nothing.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you don't point out mistakes frequently, your directs assume that, when you
do choose to talk to them, they think it's because they may be “in trouble.”
Their defensiveness, then, should not be surprising.
#+END_QUOTE

** Encourage Effective Future Behavior

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The moment you switch to a future focus, however, you free yourself up to focus
on something that you (and they) can do something about. *Regardless of whether
your direct was ineffective or effective this morning, the true purpose of any
performance communication about either situation is exactly the same: you want
more effective behavior in the future*. If your direct made a mistake, you want
different behavior. If your direct did something well, you want more of the
same.
#+END_QUOTE

The Manager Tools Feedback Model has four simple steps:

1. Ask: Ask your direct if you can give then some feedback. Also, it's an
   important managerial rule to *never ask a question of your directs if you
   don't intend to honor their answer*.
2. State the Behavior: How should one pass it's messages to one's peers.
   - The words you say: The words you choose to say out loud to others are a
   choice, and different words produce different results. *Your choice of words
   makes a difference in business results*. Furthermore, certain words are known
   to produce distinctly better results in certain situations.
   - How to say words: Watch your tone, tenor and inflection.
   - Your facial expressions: Non-verbal language actually accounts for most of
     the perceived meaning in normal conversations.
   - Body language: Same as above.
   - Work product: What you do and how well you do your job are behaviours as well.
     - Quality
     - Quantity
     - Accuracy
     - Timeliness
     - Documents

   Here are is template on how to start: "When you <behavior>...", for instance:
    - "When you are ahead of schedule..."
    - "When you stay an extra hour to find the root cause..."
    - "When you respond politely after the customer insults you..."
    - "When you make that extra call to keep the customer informed..."
    - "When you promise it to me yesterday but don't deliver..."

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Would you rather have a 15-second negative feedback
    discussion or a two-minute negative feedback discussion with
    your boss? Shorter is better. Saying “When you” will help you be
    #+END_QUOTE

3. State the Impact of the Behavior

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    (...) effective feedback isn't about waiting until there's a pattern, and it
    doesn't get better with age. And wouldn't you rather know sooner rather than
    later that there's a problem?
    #+END_QUOTE

4. Encourage Effective Future Behavior

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    When we are giving negative feedback, we are asking the direct to behave
    differently. *We're not punishing the past mistake, because we've already
    forgiven it. Remember that our focus is on the future, not the past*.
    #+END_QUOTE

5. Ask

** When should I give feedback

Feedbacks should be given as early and often as possible, if you can give
feedback right after noticing positive/negative behaviour that's ideal, of
course, make sure you do so without others overhearing.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you keep in mind that sooner is better and that there's no appreciable
decline in value during the first three to five days, you have a lot more time
and a lot more opportunities to deliver what it is your directs want—and tell us
they want. 
#+END_QUOTE

- Encouraging feedback can be given in front of other people, unless they don't
  like attention.

* Common Questions and Resistance to Feedback

First, ask yourself these three questions before offering feedback.

** The questions

*** Am I angry?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you're angry, don't give feedback. Period.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Do I want to remind or punish?

Always focus in encouraging effective future behavior.

*** Can I let it go?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you can't let it go in terms of how you feel, we recommend that you do let it
go by not giving negative feedback.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Maybe delay or defer?

If you can't pass the three tests above, you should either *delay* or *defer*.

- Delay: Hold off giving feedback for a while, a few hours won't hurt.
- Defer: If you're still angry, if you can't let it go completely, don't give
  negative feedback about the behavior. If the bad behavior is corrected, doing
  nothing worked, otherwise, you'll have the another chance to give feedback
  again.

*** The Shot across the Bow

What do I do if one of my directs pushes back or refuses feedback? If your
direct is defensive it means they likely know they're in the wrong. Do not drag
a conflict from the past and focus on the future.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Once you've given the feedback and the direct has pushed back, pause, smile,
apologize, and walk away. You've made your point.
#+END_QUOTE

** The capstone: systemic feedback

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Systemic feedback changes what you are talking to your direct about and raises
the level of consequences associated with a continued failure to
change. Systemic feedback addresses the direct's combination of continued
failure to change with the direct's stated commitment to change. It addresses
the greater failure to meet a repeated commitment. Failure to meet commitments
is a systemic failure that no organization can long
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Here is the fundamental difference. Standard feedback is about small
behaviors. Systemic feedback addresses the moral hazard of a direct committing
to new behavior but then failing to follow through. We can tolerate directs who
make mistakes. We cannot tolerate directs who repeatedly make commitments they
don't keep.
#+END_QUOTE

*** When to use it?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You should use systemic feedback when you have already given six instances of
standard feedback in a period of time that indicates a pattern, and the direct
has not been engaging in the behavior they've committed to.
#+END_QUOTE

*** How is it different?

In systemic feedbacks you're giving feedback on *the failure to meet commitments*.

*** Two dangers

1. Use the standard feedback model before applying the systemic feedback
2. Implied sanctions must be delivered

* How to start giving feedback
  
** Announce your intention in your weekly staff meeting

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Cover the purpose of feedback talk to your directs about the purpose of giving
feedback, which is to "encourage effective future behavior". 
#+END_QUOTE

- Counteract their possible fear by explaining (plainly) why you're using the
  feedback model

** Give only positive feedback for eigth weeks

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Don't give any negative feedback as you're learning to use the feedback
model. If you try to slip in some negative feedback, you run the risk of doing
it poorly because you haven't yet mastered the model and the delivery. You may
hurt the feelings of your direct.
#+END_QUOTE

- Start with one feedback per day
- If you can go five days in a row giving feedback, then raise the limit to two.

** Stay as positive as you can

- Don't overdo negative feedbacks
- Positive feedbacks are much more powerful tools than negative ones

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you believe you should be "vigilant" against "mistakes", two things will
happen gradually: you'll start seeing all the mistakes, and you'll stop seeing
all the good behaviors.
#+END_QUOTE

* Push work down - Delegation

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Learning to delegate is part of the transition to becoming an executive. Too
many managers today think that because they are smarter and more effective at
getting things done than their directs, they should try to get more done by
doing it themselves.
#+END_QUOTE

How do we know when something is a task assignment and not a delegation? 

*** Task assignment x Task delegation

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Delegation, on the other hand, is you turning over responsibility for one of
your regular responsibilities - something you routinely do - on a permanent or
long standing basis, to one of your directs.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Why Delegation Is the Solution - The Delegation

*** Delegate the Big Black Ball

- Not a good idea, since you *don't* know how to do it, how are you going to
  help your directs to do it?
- You need to understand the work before you can delegate it.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Don't ever delegate a new responsibility your boss has just given you to one of
your directs. Learn it first, master it, before
#+END_QUOTE

*** Delegate One of the Big Gray Balls

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One of your small balls is a big ball to your direct.
#+END_QUOTE

- Splitting a big ball wouldn't work either, since you'll have to coordinate the
  task anyway.

*** Delegate One or More of the Small Balls

** How to Delegate—The Manager Tools Delegation Model

1. State your desire for help
2. Tell them why you're asking them
3. Ask for specific acceptance
4. Describe the task or project in detail
5. Address deadline, quality, and reporting standards
