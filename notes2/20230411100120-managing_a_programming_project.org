#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The fact that you are managing a programming project means that you will be
running a business. You will have suppliers, you will have one or more
customers. You will have employees, you will have commitments, you will have
financial goals, you will have measured results. (...) . Your responsibility is
to manage your business so that everyone - your "investors" (the executives that
gave you the assignment), your customers (the people who will use your system
for a long time to come), your employees (...), and you - will look at your
operating results and feel a sense of satisfaction.
