** A Brief History of Hypermedia

Where did the idea of hypermedia come from?

+ The 1945 article [[id:22759a84-3a09-464f-b0f7-e5d0a7bf5295][As We May Think]], from Vanevar Bush
+ Ted Nelson's work on the "Hypertext Editing System" at Brown University and who later created the File Retrieval and Editing System (FRESS)
+ Douglas Engelbart's thesis on the "[[id:116d7265-e46f-4b42-b5ef-af1e913e2c12][The Mother of All Demos]]"

** Modern Implementation  

+ Tim Berners-Lee's "World Wide Web"
+ Roy Fielding's "[[id:f922bff8-f1ab-4322-a0af-b6eba02b2811][Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures]]"

*** The Essence of HTML as a Hypermedia
**** Anchor tags
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<a href="https://hypermedia.systems/">
  Hypermedia Systems
</a>
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
An anchor tag consists of the tag itself, ~<a></a>~, as well as the attributes
and content within the tag. Of particular interest is the href attribute, which
specifies a hypertext reference to another document or document fragment. It is
this attribute that makes the anchor tag a hypermedia control.

**** Form tags
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<form action="/signup" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Enter Email To Sign Up..."/>
  <button>Sign Up</button>
</form>
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This mechanism allows the user to issue requests to update the state of
resources on the server. Note that despite this new type of request the
communication between client and server is still done entirely with hypermedia.

It is the form tag that makes Hypermedia-Driven Applications possible.
