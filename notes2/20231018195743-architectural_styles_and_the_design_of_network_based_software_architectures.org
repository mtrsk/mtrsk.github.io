#+TITLE: Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In 2000, Roy Fielding, then at U.C. Irvine, published a seminal PhD dissertation
on the web: "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software
Architectures." Fielding had been working on the open source Apache HTTP Server
and his thesis was a description of what he felt was a new and distinct
networking architecture that had emerged in the early web. Fielding had worked
on the initial HTTP specifications and, in the paper, defined the webâ€™s
hypermedia network model using the term REpresentational State Transfer (REST).
