      <description>:ID: 1db8ac56-b188-4797-80ed-21ac950a77b9&#xA;In natural deduction, we have a collection of proof rules. They allow us to infer formulas from other formulas. By applying these rules in succession, we may infer a conclusion from a set of premises.&#xA;Suppose we have a set of formulas \(\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3, \ldots, \phi_n\), which we will call premises, and another formula, \(\psi\), which we will call a conclusion. By applying proof rules to the premises, we hope to get some more formulas, and by applying more proof rules to those, to eventually obtain the conclusion.</description>
